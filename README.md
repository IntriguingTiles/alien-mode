# Half-Life: Alien Mode

This is a mod built off of [halflife-updated](https://github.com/twhl-community/halflife-updated) that aims to accurately recreate the "Alien Mode" cheat from the PS2 port of Half-Life (HLPS2).

Nearly all of the code written for this mod is based off of reverse engineering the HLPS2 binary, so it should be reasonably close to what Gearbox actually wrote.

Most of the various code changes that HLPS2 made are implemented (minus Decay stuff), such as new entities and modified behavior. Of course, with the large size of the codebase, there's bound to be things I've missed, but I'm pretty confident that I've found the important changes.

# Requirements to run mod

Only the latest Steam version of Half-Life is supported.

# Building this mod

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)

# What isn't supported

Backwards compatibility with WON and older versions of Steam Half-Life is not supported. Xash isn't supported, but may work.

# Half-Life 1

This is the README for the Half-Life 1 engine and its associated games.

Please use this repository to report bugs and feature requests for Half-Life 1 related products.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter an issue while using Half-Life 1 games, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue;
- your system information.\*; and
- the `version` output from the in‐game console.

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

\* The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`). Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`. Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block.

## Conduct


There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Half-Life.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.
